Abstract: 

Deep learning studies are among the discipline that are rapidly increasing and developing today. Especially after the concept of big data enters our lives, deep learning methods have used to process the data. In the study, it has aimed to detect the face on the
picture determined by the user and to conduct emotional analysis and gender determination with the deep learning methods of the detected face. Viola-Jones algorithm has used for face recognition. ”Mini Xception” model of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has used for emotion analysis and gender detection. Estimation rates have measured with 18 different experiments performed. The most successful emotion recognition has measured as 93,11% and the most successful gender recognition has measured as 90,75%. Experiments within the study have supported by visual studies.

Keywords: Deep Learning, Viola-Jones Algorithm, Facial Expression Analysis, Emotion Analysis, Gender Detection.
